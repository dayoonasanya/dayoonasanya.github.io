Cloud technology offers a cost-efficient alternative to traditional IT setups. With on-premises infrastructure, businesses bear the burden of upfront hardware and maintenance costs, which can be substantial. Cloud services operate on a pay-as-you-go model, where costs align with actual usage. This "pay only for what you use" approach translates to significant savings, especially for smaller businesses that can now access enterprise-grade infrastructure without the capitalÂ expenditure.
